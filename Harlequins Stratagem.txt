WEBWAY ASSAULT
Harlequins Stratagem
Stealthily slipping from the webway, the players of the Harlequins creep behind enemy lines before they launch their assault.

Harlequins Stratagem
One amongst the hundred swords of Vaul was nothing but a fake. In this dance, so too is one band amongst the Harlequins’ ranks not what it seems.

Soaring Spite Stratagem
The Harlequins of this masque excel in the Dance of the Weaver Serpents, not even touching the ground as they fight.
Use this Stratagem just before a SOARING SPITE INFANTRY unit consolidates. Instead of moving towards the nearest enemy model, the unit consolidates up to 6" towards the nearest SOARING SPITE TRANSPORT from your army. If all models in the unit end this move within 3" of the transport, the unit may immediately embark upon it (if it has sufficient capacity remaining) as if it were the Movement phase (and can do so even if they disembarked from the transport during the same turn).

PIVOTAL ROLE
Harlequins Stratagem
Certain characters are crucial to the seamless execution of the chosen Saedath. Harlequins assuming such pivotal roles perform with nigh on supernatural grace amidst the fiery limelight of war.
Use this Stratagem before the battle. Select one TROUPE MASTER, SHADOWSEER, DEATH JESTER or SOLITAIRE model from your army. That model gains one of their respective Pivotal Role abilities. This does not replace an existing ability. Each model from your army can have no more than one Pivotal Role ability, and each Pivotal Role ability models in your army have must be different.

POLYCHROMATIC STORM
Harlequins Stratagem
In the breathless heartbeat before battle begins, the Harlequin forces explode into a kaleidoscopic myriad that bewilders the foe as to their true location and numbers.
Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins. Select up to three HARLEQUINS units from your army that are on the battlefield. Remove them from the battlefield and set them up again. When setting them up, you can use any abilities or Stratagems that would allow them to be set up in a different location during deployment (e.g. Webway Assault). If both players have abilities that redeploy units, roll off: the winner chooses who redeploys their units first. You can only use this Stratagem once.

TWILIT ENCORE
Harlequins Stratagem
The foe may not comprehend their role in the saedath – and may even try to blunder away in confusion and fear – but the steps must be observed to the bloody end.
Use this Stratagem in your opponent’s Movement phase, when an enemy unit within 1" of a HARLEQUINS TROUPE unit from your army Falls Back. After that enemy unit has moved, that HARLEQUINS TROUPE unit can consolidate up to 6"; each model in that HARLEQUINS TROUPE unit must end that move closer to the closest model from the unit that Fell Back, or, if another enemy unit is now closer, the closest enemy model.

Those hapless fools who strike down a Solitaire only doom themselves, for to catch the eye of one so damned is to be tainted by that same dark fate.
