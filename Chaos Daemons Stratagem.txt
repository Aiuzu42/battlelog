DENIZENS OF THE WARP
Chaos Daemons Stratagem
Ever lurking in the warp, Daemons will wait until the barriers between realms thin before tearing their way into realspace.
Use this Stratagem during deployment. If you spent 1 CP, set up one of your DAEMON units that has a Power Rating of 8 or less in the warp instead of placing it on the battlefield. If you spent 2 CPs, you can choose a DAEMON unit that has a Power Rating of 9 or more instead. At the end of any of your Movement phases that unit can tear its way into reality – set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models.

DAEMONIC INCURSION
Chaos Daemons Stratagem
When the Knights of Titan deploy to battle, it is often to combat a full-blown daemonic invasion.
Use this Stratagem when one of your DAEMON units (other than a named character) is destroyed by a GREY KNIGHTS unit. The destroyed unit is returned to your army at full strength, and is set up on the battlefield at the end of your next Movement phase, anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" from any enemy models. This does not cost you any reinforcement points in a matched play game.

In addition, re-roll hit rolls of 1 for the summoned unit while it is within 6" of the character that performed the Daemonic Ritual.
